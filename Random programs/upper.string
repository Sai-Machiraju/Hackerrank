Write a function that takes in a string and an integer  𝑛  and prints the string with only the first  𝑛  letters capitalized.
python code:

def upperCASE(x, n):
    """Takes in a string x and an integer n and returns the string with the first n letters capitalized."""
    s=""
    for i in range(0,n):
        s=s+x[i].capitalize()
    for i in range(n,len(x)):
        s=s+x[i]
    return s
