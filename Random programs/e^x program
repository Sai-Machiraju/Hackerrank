Write a function that takes in an integer  𝑛  and prints the  𝑛 -th Taylor approximation to the number  𝑒 . By this we mean, complete the function below and use the code provided to sum the first  𝑛  terms of the series
           𝑒𝑥=1+𝑥+𝑥22!+𝑥33!+𝑥44!+⋯
 
when  𝑥=1 .

python code:

    def factorial(n):
    total=1
    j=1
    while j <= n:
        total=total*j
        j=j+1
    return total

def partial_e_series(n):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    e=1
    x=1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
       e=e+((x**i)/factorial(i))
    return e
